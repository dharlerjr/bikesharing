## Overview of Analysis
In this analysis, our primary objectives are...
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out, for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour, of each day of the week, AND...
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

If we are able to complete these tasks, there's no chance that the angel investors aren't sold on our bike-sharing program for Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
1. Checkout Times for All Users \
By examining our first story point, we see that a majority of bikes are returned within 20 minutes of checkout.

2. Checkout Times by Gender \
Furthermore, our result from 1. holds true even when filtering by Gender. In other words, within each gender type, a majority of bikes are still returned within 20 minutes of checkout.

3. Trips by Weekday for Each Hour \
Next, our Trips by Weekday for Each Hour heatmap conveys two logical conclusions. During the work week, most bike trips are taken before work (7am - 8am) and after work (5pm - 7pm). However, during the weekend, most bike trips are taken between the hours of 11am and 6pm. 

4. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) \
Our trend from 3. holds true when filtering by gender. However, we see that overall, KNOWN males take more trips than KNOWN females.

5. User Trips by Gender by Weekday \
Lastly, male subscribers are by far the most popular bikeriding group.

## Summary
In summary, no matter the gender or user, almost 140k bike trips occurred during the month of August in NYC. Given that our city is not as populous, we can't expect the same numbers at first in Des Moines, Iowa. However, by targeting male subscribers and encouraging users of all genders to commute to and from work, our bikeshare program has plenty of potential for growth.
